       token_id bigint not null auto_increment,
        token varchar(255),
        token_creation_date date,
        fk_user_id bigint,
        primary key (token_id)
        )
    	
    	create table post (
       post_id bigint not null auto_increment,
        created_date datetime(6),

        updated_date datetime(6),
        fk_user_id bigint not null,
        primary key (post_id)
        )

       drop index UK_j09k2v8lxofv2vecxu2hde9so
       
       alter table authentication_token 
       add constraint FKh1d4j9xvy9w1g1kfttfnedeh5
